There are 3 branches in this project which containes a "project setup".
You can call git commands to check each branch. 

Can you tell which project setup is better and why?

git branch -a

Below is a concise comparison of the three branches that contain a project setup.  The criteria I focused on are: documentation & onboarding, environment segregation (dev vs prod), security hardening, extensibility, and operational ergonomics.  I only looked at material that is actually present in each branch—nothing inferred.

-------------------------------------------------
1. Branch `o3`  (minimal baseline)
• Docker-Compose: 2 services (LiteLLM + Caddy), latest tags, no dev override.  
• Caddyfile: basic reverse-proxy only.  
• Config: single `litellm-config.yaml` with one OpenAI model.  
• No README, scripts, or env management helpers.

➜ Strengths  
 – Simple, quick to get running.  

➜ Weaknesses  
 – Uses `latest` image tags → non-reproducible builds.  
 – No dev/production split, no health-check dependency, almost no security headers.  
 – No onboarding material or automation helpers.

-------------------------------------------------
2. Branch `gemini-2.5-pro`  (streamlined but stable)
• Docker-Compose: 2 services, ​pins​ LiteLLM to `main-v1.35.13` (good), uses `.env` file, ships health-checks.  
• Caddyfile: adds useful security headers and file logging.  
• Config: lives under `litellm-config/` with production & dev YAMLs.  
• Documentation: only a high-level `litellm_infra_plan.md` (no quick-start README).  
• No dev override, no helper scripts, optional services commented but not wired.

➜ Strengths  
 – Pinned image tag for deterministic deploys.  
 – Reasonable Caddy hardening (headers + HTTPS).  
 – Uses `env_file` to keep secrets out of compose.  

➜ Weaknesses  
 – Lacks a dev override, so port 80/443 always used (awkward on local dev).  
 – Missing onboarding/automation scripts.  
 – No extension services and no monitoring hooks prepared.

-------------------------------------------------
3. Branch `claude-4-sonnet`  (feature-rich, most complete)
• Docker-Compose primary file + two companions:  
 - `docker-compose.override.yml` for local dev (changes ports to 8080, mounts dev config, verbose logging).  
 - `docker-compose.extensions.yml` with opt-in services: Ollama, Postgres, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana.  
• Health-checks and restart policies on every service.  
• Caddyfile: HTTPS, HSTS, security headers, optional basic-auth, rate-limiting, HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect, per-upstream health checking.  
• Config: separate prod & dev YAMLs; API keys via `os.environ/*` (compatible with `.env`).  
• Automation: `scripts/setup.sh` wizard (creates `.env`, starts/stops dev or prod, runs health checks, smoke tests).  
• Documentation: 200-line README with quick-start, prod instructions, API examples, architecture diagram, and monitoring tips.

➜ Strengths  
 ✓ Best onboarding experience (README + script).  
 ✓ Clean separation dev vs prod; local runs don’t need privileged ports.  
 ✓ Security extras (rate-limit, headers, HTTPS redirect).  
 ✓ Extensibility baked in (optional services file).  
 ✓ Health-checks ensure Caddy waits for LiteLLM.  

➜ Weaknesses  
 – Uses `latest` tags instead of pinning (easy to fix).  
 – Slightly more moving parts, so beginners must read the docs (the included docs cover this).

-------------------------------------------------
🏆 Recommendation
`claude-4-sonnet` is the strongest overall setup.  It balances completeness and usability:

1. **Operational safety** – health checks, restart policies, and rate-limiting reduce downtime and abuse.
2. **Developer ergonomics** – dev override and helper script mean “clone + ./scripts/setup.sh dev” is all you need.
3. **Security posture** – HTTPS by default, hardened headers, optional basic-auth, API key routing.
4. **Extensibility & observability** – drop-in compose file for DB, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana; log formats already set.
5. **Documentation** – full README, comments in every config, guided prompts in the script.

If you want the determinism of pinned image tags from `gemini-2.5-pro`, simply change the LiteLLM tag in `claude-4-sonnet` from `latest` to a versioned tag—then you get the best of both worlds.
