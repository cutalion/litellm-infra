There are 3 branches in this project which containes a "project setup".
You can call git commands to check each branch. 

Can you tell which project setup is better and why?

---

I'll help you analyze the different project setups across the branches. Let me start by checking what branches are available and then examine each one.
```bash
git branch -a
```
Now let me check the current branch (main) first to see its project setup, then examine the other branches:

Let me examine each branch to see their project setups. I'll start by checking each branch and their contents:
```bash
git checkout claude-4-sonnet
```
Ran tool

```bash
git checkout gemini-2.5-pro
```

Ran tool

```bash
git checkout o3
```
Ran tool

Now let me examine the key configuration files from each branch to understand their project setups in detail. I'll read the README files, docker-compose configurations, and other setup files:
```bash
git checkout claude-4-sonnet
```
Read file: README.md

Now let me examine the docker-compose and configuration files from this branch, and then switch to the other branches to compare:
Read file: docker-compose.yml
Read file: docker-compose.override.yml
Read file: litellm-config.yaml

Now let me check the gemini-2.5-pro branch:
```bash
git checkout gemini-2.5-pro
```

Read file: docker-compose.yml

Ran tool

Read file: litellm-config/litellm-config.yaml

Now let me check the o3 branch setup:
```bash
git checkout o3
```

Read file: docker-compose.yml

Read file: litellm-config.yaml

Let me also check if there are any additional setup files in the scripts directory from the claude-4-sonnet branch:
```bash
git checkout claude-4-sonnet
```

Ran tool

Read file: docker-compose.extensions.yml

Based on my analysis of all three branches, here's my comprehensive comparison of the project setups:

## üèÜ **Winner: claude-4-sonnet branch**

## Detailed Analysis:

### **1. claude-4-sonnet Branch** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Strengths:**
- **Most comprehensive documentation**: Detailed README with clear setup instructions, API usage examples, architecture diagrams, and security considerations
- **Development/Production separation**: Clean separation with `docker-compose.override.yml` for dev and separate configs for production
- **Extensibility**: Includes `docker-compose.extensions.yml` with optional services (Ollama, PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana)
- **Setup automation**: Includes `scripts/setup.sh` for automated configuration
- **Better configuration**: More sophisticated LiteLLM config with callbacks, monitoring, and security features
- **Clear file organization**: Logical file structure with separate dev/prod configurations

### **2. gemini-2.5-pro Branch** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Strengths:**
- **Modular structure**: Well-organized with separate directories for `litellm-config/` and `caddy-config/`
- **Version pinning**: Uses specific version tags for stability (`ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-v1.35.13`)
- **Advanced routing**: More sophisticated routing strategy with failovers and load balancing
- **Better naming**: Uses more descriptive container names (`litellm_prod`, `caddy_prod`)

**Weaknesses:**
- **No documentation**: Missing README file with setup instructions
- **No development environment**: No development overrides or simplified dev setup
- **No automation**: No setup scripts or helper tools

### **3. o3 Branch** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Strengths:**
- **Simplicity**: Minimal, straightforward setup
- **Clean configuration**: Simple LiteLLM config that's easy to understand

**Weaknesses:**
- **No documentation**: No README or setup instructions
- **No development environment**: No dev/prod separation
- **Minimal features**: Basic configuration without advanced routing or monitoring
- **No extensibility**: No optional services or extensions
- **Missing health checks**: Docker Compose lacks proper dependency management

## **Why claude-4-sonnet is the Best:**

1. **üìö Complete Documentation**: The comprehensive README makes it immediately usable by any developer
2. **üîß Developer Experience**: Clear dev/prod separation with override files
3. **üöÄ Production Ready**: Proper health checks, security considerations, and deployment instructions
4. **üìà Scalability**: Extensions file provides clear path for adding monitoring, caching, and local LLMs
5. **üõ†Ô∏è Automation**: Setup scripts reduce manual configuration errors
6. **üîê Security**: Better security configuration with proper environment variable handling

## **Recommendation:**

**Use the `claude-4-sonnet` branch** as your foundation. It provides:
- The most professional and maintainable setup
- Clear documentation for team onboarding
- Proper development workflow
- Production-ready configuration
- Extensibility for future growth

If you need the specific routing features from `gemini-2.5-pro`, you can easily integrate them into the claude-4-sonnet setup by updating the LiteLLM configuration file.
